    <em>
      Coaching is not psychotherapy or medical, legal, tax, or financial advice.
      The client remains fully responsible for their own decisions and
      implementation.

  <h2>Frame & Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    I am not a big fan of contracts, but they clearly have their place and value
    in our world. Transparent communication is always essential. Whenever you
    feel misled, overlooked, or misunderstood, please reach out to me — even
    during a session (in that case, it won’t count as a coaching session).
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, the co-creation aspect of coaching is key. It’s not about me working
    magic, nor about you carrying all the responsibility. It is about two
    conscious minds coming together to focus on your challenges and
    transformation — co-creating space for new awareness and solutions. This is
    not only the power of coaching — it is the power of genuine human
    connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Values worth highlighting here: Responsibility, dedication, mindfulness,
    hard work, trust, respect, transparency, openness, empathy, reliability,
    humor, progress, and professionalism.
